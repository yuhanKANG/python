    <h1 style="color: darkorchid;">Look! the optical illusions.</h1>
    <h2 style="color:green;">Within visual perception, an optical illusion (also called a visual illusion) is an illusion 
        caused by the visual system and characterized by a visual percept that arguably appears 
        to differ from reality. Illusions come in a wide variety; their categorization is difficult 
        because the underlying cause is often not clear but a classification proposed by 
        Richard Gregory is useful as an orientation. According to that, there are three main classes: 
        physical, physiological, and cognitive illusions, and in each class there are four kinds: 
        Ambiguities, distortions, paradoxes, and fictions. A classical example for a physical distortion 
        would be the apparent bending of a stick half immerged in water; an example for a physiological 
        paradox is the motion aftereffect (where, despite movement, position remains unchanged). 
        An example for a physiological fiction is an afterimage. Three typical cognitive distortions are 
        the Ponzo, Poggendorff, and Müller-Lyer illusion. Physical illusions are caused by the physical 
        environment, e.g. by the optical properties of water. Physiological illusions arise in the eye or 
        the visual pathway, e.g. from the effects of excessive stimulation of a specific receptor type. 
        Cognitive visual illusions are the result of unconscious inferences and are perhaps those most 
        widely known</h2>
